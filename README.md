# open-syllabus
Extracting data from the field section of the opensyllabus site

Using the API that was for the site, we extracted the url of the first 1000 parts of each field, 
and using this program that we wrote, we request each url and save it in a csv file.
And this program was written with the help of my good friend @ilia4bit
